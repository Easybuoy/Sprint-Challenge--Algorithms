#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
1 -> O(c)
2 -> O(n ^ 3)
3 -> O(c)
Runtime complexity = O(n^3)

b)
1 -> O(c)
2 -> O(n)
3 -> O(c)
4 -> O(c * n)
5 -> O(c)
6 -> O(c)
Runtime complexity = O(n^2)

c)
1 -> O(c)
2 -> O(c)
3 -> O(c + n)
Runtime complexity = O(n)

## Exercise II
set current floor to 0
throw egg
if egg does not break 
increment current floor
throw egg
if egg breaks 
return current floor

Runtime complexity = O(n)
