#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
1 -> O(c)
2 -> O(n ^ 3)
3 -> O(c)
Runtime complexity = O(n^3)

b)
1 -> O(c)
2 -> O(n)
3 -> O(c)
4 -> O(c * n)
5 -> O(c)
6 -> O(c)
Runtime complexity = O(n^2)

c)

## Exercise II

for building in buildings
if floor>=  f
break egg
else
do nothing to the egg
